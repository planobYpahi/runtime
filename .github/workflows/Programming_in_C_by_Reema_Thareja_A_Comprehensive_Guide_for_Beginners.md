The book also includes numerous examples, exercises, and programming projects to help you practice and master the concepts. You can download the PDF version of the book from various online sources for free or at a low cost. However, we recommend that you buy the original book from Oxford University Press or any other authorized seller to support the author and get access to additional resources.
 
In this article, we will give you a brief overview of the book and its contents. We will also share some of the benefits of learning C programming and why you should choose this book as your guide.
 
## What is C Programming?
 
C is a general-purpose, structured, and low-level programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It is one of the most widely used and influential programming languages in the world. It is used to create system software, operating systems, compilers, libraries, embedded systems, games, and applications for various domains.
 
C is a powerful and flexible language that gives you direct access to the hardware and memory. It also allows you to manipulate data using pointers and bitwise operators. C is a compiled language, which means that the source code is converted into executable code by a compiler before running on a machine. This makes C programs fast and efficient.
 
C is also a portable language, which means that you can write a C program on one platform and run it on another with little or no modification. C has a standard library that provides a set of predefined functions for common tasks such as input/output, string manipulation, mathematical operations, etc. C also supports user-defined functions that allow you to create your own reusable code modules.
 
## Why Learn C Programming?
 
Learning C programming can have many benefits for your career and personal development. Some of them are:
 
- C is the foundation of many other programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, etc. Learning C will help you understand the basic syntax and logic of these languages and make it easier for you to learn them later.
- C is widely used in the industry for developing system software, operating systems, embedded systems, etc. Learning C will give you an edge in getting jobs or projects in these domains.
- C is a low-level language that gives you control over the hardware and memory. Learning C will help you understand how computers work at a deeper level and improve your problem-solving and debugging skills.
- C is a simple and elegant language that has a minimal set of keywords and rules. Learning C will help you develop a clear and concise coding style and improve your logical thinking and creativity.
- C is a fun and challenging language that allows you to create games, graphics, animations, etc. Learning C will help you explore your interests and hobbies and enjoy programming as an art.

## What Does Programming in C by Reema Thareja Cover?
 
Programming in C by Reema Thareja is divided into 14 chapters that cover all the essential topics of C programming. The book starts with an introduction to programming in general followed by a detailed introduction to C programming. It then delves into a complete analysis of various constructs of C such as decision control and looping statements, functions, arrays, strings, pointers, structure and union, file management, and pre-processor directives.
  
The book also covers some advanced topics such as dynamic memory allocation, command-line arguments, graphics programming, and recursion. The book also includes two appendices that provide a quick reference to the C library functions and some useful tips for debugging C programs.
  
The book follows a systematic and step-by-step approach
